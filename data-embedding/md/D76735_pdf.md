DECISION &amp; ORDER

The People, etc., respondent, v Rahshon Leach, appellant.

(Ind. No. 556/18)

Twyla Carter, New York, NY (Dalourny Nemorin of counsel), for appellant.

Melinda  Katz,  District  Attorney,  Kew  Gardens,  NY  (Johnnette  Traill,  Nancy Fitzpatrick Talcott, and Nicholas Isaacson of counsel), for respondent.

Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the Supreme Court, Queens County (Evelyn L. Braun, J.), rendered June 30, 2022, convicting him of attempted criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree, upon his plea of guilty, and imposing sentence.

ORDERED that the judgment is affirmed.

Contrary to the defendant's contention, the record demonstrates that he knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently waived his right to appeal ( see People v Thomas , 34 NY3d 545; People v Lopez , 6 NY3d 248).  The defendant's valid waiver of his right to appeal precludes appellate review  of  his  challenge  to  the  Supreme  Court's  suppression  determination  ( see People  v Hightower-Castro , 219 AD3d 504, 505; People v Oneal , 202 AD3d 710).

BARROS, J.P., BRATHWAITE NELSON, TAYLOR and VENTURA, JJ., concur.

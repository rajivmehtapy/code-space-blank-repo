The People, etc., respondent, v Charles L. Stoll, appellant.

(Ind. No. 701707/23)

Steven N. Feinman, White Plains, NY, for appellant.

Robert V. Tendy, District Attorney, Carmel, NY, for respondent.

Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the County Court, Putnam County (Joseph J. Spofford, Jr.), rendered May 7, 2024, convicting him of burglary in the third degree, grand larceny in the fourth degree, and possession of burglar's tools, upon his plea of guilty, and imposing sentence.

ORDERED that the judgment is affirmed.

In  light  of  the  defendant's  extensive  criminal  record,  which  involves  felony convictions,  the  County  Court  providently  exercised  its  discretion  in  denying  the  defendant's application to participate in a judicial diversion program ( see People v O'Keefe , 112 AD3d 524; People v Powell , 110 AD3d 1383; People v Williams , 105 AD3d 1428).

BARROS, J.P., BRATHWAITE NELSON, TAYLOR and VENTURA, JJ., concur.

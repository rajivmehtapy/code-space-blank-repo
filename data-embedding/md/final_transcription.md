Look what happened to the court. Right? Yes. Exactly. I'll give you a minute.

So the first case out for argument today is people versus anwar

good morning your honors may please the court council james ostrowski proceed

um playing off of your prior remarks so lawyers are here to help people and um I've been involved in this case a long time, and I hope I do justice to my client's cause today.

Mr. Oshesky, I'm sure you're going to. Let me suggest something, though. You've listed a lot of arguments for us to chew on, and you can trust that we've read through the papers before us on this case. I, for one, would love to hear you address your claim of ineffective assistance of counsel as it relates to the failure to have an interpreter present at trial. Would you begin with that point?

Yes, Your Honor. And I think that we've got the Strickland test and the Baldy test, and this court knows them both better than I do. But I think that the Baldy test is a little bit more favorable to the defendant because it talks about a meaningful representation, which I really think at the end of the day means fair. leave aside the proof and I don't concede that this was a overwhelming case at all quite the opposite but even if it was overwhelming the gentleman deserves a right to from their first police interrogation to all through the trial to understand what's going on and to be able to communicate to the best of his ability and I know it's in the brief Your Honor but forgive me uh one of the quotes from my from uh mr anwar i actually don't know like how i say it in english but like i don't know how to say it in english i'm sorry i won't belabor the court with there's numerous citations to that effect and really worse and the problem with a client who can't really articulate. I tell my clients, answer directly. Answer as quickly as you can, because if you hesitate, it looks like you're lying. There's just no way to tell the difference. So he's got all these hesitations, and the jury has to be wondering, well, is he hesitating because he's lying? The jury isn't informed by anybody, by the court, that he needs a translator. So it affected every aspect of the trial. The interrogation itself, and I know counsel mysteriously withdrew that suppression motion. If you look at that, it's hard to watch. He's in a cold room. He's hemmed in by two large officers. He's struggling with the Miranda warning. So right at the, do you question, do you, how well do you read English? Well, not that great. I'm paraphrasing. It's in the record. Right from the beginning of the case. And I just read the prosecutor's cross and the prosecutor's summation, which are obviously two of the biggest parts of any trial. And she absolutely hammered him with some of the answers in that cold room police interrogation. So he started out with a translator. There's in the records of Dr. Murphy, there's a reference that he came with a translator. He starts out with a translator, the first several court appearances. And at some point, I mean, believe it or not, Your Honors, the Honorable Judge asks a court deputy if he's a translator. No, that's not the court deputy's determination. So I think that...

He asked the court deputy if he needed a translator, not if he was a translator.

I apologize. That's up to the judge. But ultimately, in a case like this, Brendan Sullivan, I won't say the exact phrase, but in the Iran-Contra hearings, let me paraphrase it. He said, you can't be a bystander as a lawyer. You can't be shy. You It can be oh I afraid I always tell juries and voir dire I going to object her in prosecutor summation It not a question of rudeness It doing my job It up to the attorney to fight for a translator He never did. In addition, yes, Rene.

Counsel, in the motion papers seeking the 440 hearing, looking at your client's affidavit, I don't see anything in the affidavit that says that he ever told the attorney that he didn't understand something or he was trying or struggling. He doesn't seem to make that claim now in the 440 motion. My question is, does he have to make that claim now? Is that sort of critical to this issue?

I believe that I believe his affidavit addresses the translator issue that the attorney told him that that the judge said he has to pay for a translator and he said he didn't have the money to pay for it. So I think he was communicating to his attorney that he needed a translator by saying I can't afford one.

Yes.

Yes. And again, the prior history and numerous. numerous.

And when you say the prior history, you're talking about the prior court proceedings where he had a translator.

Had a translator. So that was, that should have been.

And then the affidavits before the court below on the 440 included the doctor's affidavit that said you need a translator for purposes of the doctor's appointment?

Well, it was inadvertent, but thereby adding some credibility because the doctor, Dr. Murphy's a hand surgeon. He's not, he doesn't understand the issue of translator. He just happened to notice, note in the records that he came with a translator. So in addition to the translation issue, and I know time is limited, the cluster of medical records errors and missing witnesses. Now, I note that the jury, I always pay very close attention, the jury deliberated for eight hours 28 minutes minus meals, seven notes, 12 requests. So I'm not going to get into, you know, whether the evidence was overwhelming or not. The jury didn't think it was. The jury studied this case very hard. And what was the tiebreaker? The tiebreaker, again, the prosecutor's summation, the key to any, if you want to know why somebody got convicted, look at the prosecutor's summation. She hammered the medical evidence. In fact, she started testifying as a witness. I'm a member of the Special Victims Unit, and I'm telling you this, that, and the other thing. No objection, of course, from counsel. But the medical records certainly was the tiebreaker in a close case. And not having an expert witness as the People v. Ezi, a case I handled as a young lawyer. You've got to have an expert in these cases where medical evidence, unless you're the greatest, you know, unless you're Harold Price-Farringer or Harold Boreanaz, and you're really going to make that expert into your own expert. No, you've got to get an expert. And not having the hand surgeon in, was it a big deal? Well, who knows what a big deal was? We don't know what the side of this case laid on a Friday, which is another, I think, problem in the case. that the complainant testified that he used his left hand. I corrected that in the reply brief. He's got a disabled left hand. So yes, you bring that doctor in. Nobody knows what reasonable doubt's going to be in advance. The medical records from the hospital. I mean, it's one thing for counsel not to say, can we have a missing, you know, trials have been won and lost on missing witness inferences. We live on that stuff all day long. Not only did he not ask for a missing witness inference for these records, but the prosecutor got up during the trial, during the cross and during the summation. I think I said, I think we counted, the prosecutor mentioned those missing records nine times. Oh, those records would have helped us. Are you kidding me? That's just unacceptable. I'm not going to use an adjective. Unacceptable for counsel, again, to sit there as a bystander. You're not a bystander. You're fighting for your client. That's why the founders put this in because they knew what it was like not to have an attorney. You have to fight for your client. It's not that hard to do that. So the missing medical records, the lack of an expert, the missing hand surgeon, those were the tiebreaker. and lack, just to, I don't know how much time I have.

You should be wrapping up, Pastor.

Yeah, and by the way, well, the failure to call what I struggling to say is the lack of representation here affected everything There was no investigation The translator issue during the trial, not calling witnesses, not interviewing witnesses. It affected everything. The plea, that plea should be back on the table. Yes, we want a new trial.

At page three, though, he actually talks to the judge, your client does, and he says, I'm going to go to trial, judge. What I'm saying, Ron- So he's understanding what's going on when they're doing the plea discussion back on, what was this, November, January 9th, 2012.

What I'm saying is he had literally five minutes because the counselor did not come to his prison. Yeah, we don't like to go to the holding center, but we had to do it back in the day when I was doing those types of cases more than I am now. There was a lack of preparation, but the errors of counsel affected every stage in the proceeding. And in so many different tidbits, where's the charger? That's why the lady was there. Where's the charger in evidence? You can at least make that argument, save it for summation, they say. Can you make that argument on summation? No. And I just want to point out to close, I've been talking for about as long as the complainants and the defendant were talking on the phone before he went over to the apartment. Can you talk about a charger for 10 minutes, Your Honors? I don't think so. Thank you very much.

Good morning, Your Honor. It's David Bassett for the people. I just wanted to respond to the interpreter issue. As Justice Keene said, the record shows that the defendant had the ability to understand what was going on. He did not have such a significant language barrier that he could not understand the proceedings, and that is what the law requires. It does not require him to be able to speak English as a first language or speak it perfectly. He came here from Iraq several years before his arrest. He had worked allegedly with troops in Iraq, American troops, speaking English before he came here. And he was able to follow the proceedings all the way along, frequently interjecting on his own, showing that he was able to speak English. And counsel knew this from interacting with him extensively. Therefore, counsel is not ineffective for not getting him an interpreter. And counsel made that clear when he said an appearance on November of 2011. We're not requesting an interpreter. It's not necessary.

If we can't raise one of the circumstances. I have a couple of questions about that court appearance. First of all, from my reading of it, I met 213 of the record. Defendants not there. Dependants actually not there that day, at least not yet, because the court says this is where the court starts out. I'm informed by the court, the custody deputies that Mr. Anwar does indeed understand English. This is after he'd had an interpreter the whole time. So that's where the court says that. And then the attorney says, I figured I'd have Mr. Anwar brought over. He's not there. And then he says the very next sentence, but in speaking to him for the record, he's not requesting an interpreter. So now that if he's doing it in the absence of the defendant, and then he makes a reference to Mr. Mohammed, and he says he also speaks English very, very well. He's referring to Mr. Mohammed, but by using the word also, of course, that implies that the defendant speaks English very, very well. And that's the representation that the attorney's making. Isn't that contradicted by Mr. Anwar's affidavit, where he talks about it again, as Mr. Ostrowski brought out, I can't afford an interpreter, you know, talks about the money issue. Isn't he saying, isn't he essentially contradicting what his attorney represented to the court? And if that's the case, don't we need to hear it?

Well, I would submit no. He is saying now, 10 years after the fact, that he has difficulty. He says, there were many times during my interrogation trial where I was confused by a language. He does not say I was unable to understand the language. He does not say that he requested an interpreter.

So if you're confused, does it mean you understand? Is that your argument?

Excuse me?

When he says, I'm confused, should we interpret that to mean he understands?

I don't think you should credit his statement that he was confused, given that it's self-serving, unsupported by anything else.

All those things can be challenged at a hearing, at a 440 hearing. The judge runs a hearing and takes testimony and allows for cross-examination. It's all challenged then. And then the court maybe very well after hearing the witnesses says yeah this witness can proceed without or was proper to proceed without an interpreter or not Why wouldn the judge below based upon the information present, run the hearing just to make a determination based upon the testimony before the judge, who, by the way, was not the judge that sat on the trial?

Correct. The judge that heard the 440 motion heard oral arguments on this. He looked at the full record and he concluded that this claim of ineffective assistance of counsel had no merit.

I recognize that's what the judge did. What I'm saying is when you do have some of the information that was before the judge relative to the affidavits, right, saying by the defendant saying, I didn't understand what was going on. I was confused. The doctor who said he brought in a person with him who was helping with the interpretation, when that stuff is before you, where's the harm in running a hearing to make the decision based upon the testimony that can then be challenged?

Just well, I think the harm is that if a defendant could contradict the entire record with a self-serving affidavit, 10 years after his conviction, every 440 motion turns into a hearing.

I'm not saying make a determination that it was ineffective based upon his affidavit, which you depict as self-serving, which I think is fair to say any defendant's affidavit is going to be self-serving. But I'm not saying the judge should have made a determination based upon the defendant's affidavit. I'm not saying that at all. I'm saying, isn't there enough here before the judge for the judge to say, we should run a hearing, to allow for that affidavit to be challenged?

Our position is there was not enough, that the record as a whole showed that that allegation was not true, that he could not, his claim that he could not understand English was not true. If you look at the trial record, he is able to articulate his thoughts. He testifies extensively. His attorney puts him on the stand, tells the whole encounter from start to end as one of consensual sex. That was his whole defense relied on him articulating that in English. And he was able to do so. Jury didn't believe him, but that does not mean that he wasn't able to express himself and understand the English language sufficiently to give him a fair trial.

I understand your argument. Anything further?

No, Your Honor.

I'm sorry. I apologize. One real small point. Counsel brought up about this idea of hesitating when he's on the stand, you know, the way that he's giving testimony. Did you see evidence of that in the record yourself?

the way that he gave the testimony to stand being that's somewhat hard to decipher from the transcript your honor

um might might have been easier to decipher from a hearing you're asking him to decipher now that he's been in prison for 10 years speaking in english his ability to speak language english language now versus how he was able to then

no no i'm saying if you have a hearing and you have the transcript and you can go back and talk about this part and that part you can ask counsel and you can ask him isn't isn't that a little bit wouldn't that be a little bit more clear? Did you understand this part? Did you understand that part? Do you understand what I'm saying?

I understand what you're saying. I don't, I think he, his claim requires more than that. He has to show an inability to understand the proceedings. Not that he had a few hesitations before. And if you look at the transcript, he ultimately reaches the, I think, expression and thought that he's looking for. Hesitation does not show misunderstanding, confusion, or lack of ability to speak English. It's English as a second language. That is perfectly acceptable for someone in that position to go to trial without an interpreter. That's our position.

One more thing, Counseling. it is tough to get a full idea of the flow of the words from a transcript, but we do have some actual in time, give and take, and that would be the tape of the brandizing. And do you feel that it's clear in there? And I've seen it. And do you think it's clear in there that he understands everything that's happening, not only the words, but the import of those words?

I think some hesitation is natural in that context, given the police environment. But if you look at the way things are explained to him, they take it slow, they express these questions. in a way that allows them to understand them. Again, doesn't have to be speaking 100% in the way you or I might, but in a way that clearly shows that he understands what is being asked of him, and he understands what he's saying and the import of what he's saying.

But did they ever even ask him did he understand for Miranda? Did anybody ever say, do you understand? I don't recall anyone even asking him with the Miranda warning.

I think that is reflected by his words and his conduct in the interview that he understands. Thank you, Your Honor.

Thank you, Chelsea.

Calling cases 147 and 152. Thank you.

Good morning. Hold on, Councilor. Are we waiting for Mr. Otis? I believe we are. Here we go. All right, counsel, can you all hear me?

Yes.

Yes.

Okay, and Mr. DiGiorgio, am I pronouncing that correctly?

Yes, Judge. Yes, you can hear us and I can hear you.

Mr. Strang, can you unmute, just unmute your, so we can hear you?

Yes.

Okay, very much. Mr. Otis.

Yes.

Very good. Why don't we proceed?

Thank you, counsel.

Thank you, Judge. Good morning. Here to Georgio for the appellant. I'll start off with the appeal on the B docket, and I'm going to reserve my comments, which will be brief, to points one and two. Doing a lot of family court work and permanent neglect petitions, that dispositional order that's entered under the N docket is kind of the roadmap that parties need to use to to get their children back. As this court's aware, the standards clear and convincing evidence that he has failed to repeatedly and substantially plan for the return of his children. And just the numbers alone, there was 20 items of requirements in that dispositional order, and I counted seven or more that weren't even addressed at the fact-finding hearing on the on the permanent neglect. And the trial court essentially found that it was Mr. Towsley's attitude and his anger that prohibited him from completing a lot of the services and putting him in a position to have a return of these children. I know the court can look at, I've spelled out each of the dispositional requirements in the end docket in my brief and what proof there was. And I know the court can navigate through that, but there really has to be addressed by this court because I don't see much in it in the decisions that I've researched of claims of social service departments saying that a client doesn't benefit from services. The standard is for permanent neglect, does one repeatedly and substantially plan for the return of a child. It doesn't say repeatedly, substantially benefit from the services that are provided. Now, I know that's a fine line and that someone could deliberately try to not benefit to be an obstructionist, but he did do a lot of services here. I know he visited with the children, although he didn't miss visits, but the question for this court, and I asked the court to, and obviously you will go through the record carefully, is this a case where there is a repeated and substantial failure to get the children returned. He did have a number of services that he did, anger management, parenting. So I'd ask the court to look at that. With regard to point two, as this court's aware, one of the dispositional options that the trial court would have would be to give a suspended judgment. It's kind of a second chance. I think the appellate courts have deemed it a second chance for a parent.

Counsel, with respect to that, the children at the time of the dispositional hearing, they had been in foster care for three years, had they not?

Yes.

Yeah and that a lengthy period of time for foster care Could that have been one of the factors that the court considered when determining whether or not to give additional time

It is one of the factors. But also keep in mind, and this is not borne out in this record, that oftentimes the proceedings alone will take a significant period of time by the time we get to an order of disposition. I don't know if in this case, because I don't have it specifically in front of me, whether the petition was brought within the first 15 months or not. And the children's age. I mean, they're represented by an AFC is going to advocate for their position. But I think it's got to be weighed with what is the parent doing? And in this case, Mr. Towsley was attending anger management. He was making progress. He was doing his mental health. He was visiting the children. and they're showing that his anger had subsided during some of these visits. And I think given that these children were not infants, they were, I mean, they're not older, but they were not that young either, that a second chance should have been afforded.

Let me ask you a question, though. Didn't the court, before the dispo, order DSS to increase the counseling and increase visits kind of as a second chance before the dispo order bill that happened, right?

Yes, but I think that's all, your honor, part of diligent efforts to up the diligent efforts. I think the purpose of the suspended judgment is once the parent realizes, hey, it's D-Day here, you haven't done what you need to do, does the parent wake up and come around and isn't the children's best interest? It's a balancing. I realize it's not clear and convincing at that point, it's best interest. But again, this is outside the record, having been in the trenches in family court and being an AFC, there's a lot of times situations kids don't get adopted. Kids linger in foster care even after the termination of parental rights. So I think it's incumbent upon litigators and courts to look at the suspended judgment as a more of an option for parents who've had their rights terminated. Thank you, counsel.

Unless there's questions, would you like me to move on to the, I can briefly discuss the other appeal, or are we going to recall that case?

No, no, do it right now.

Okay. The other appeal on the face looks moot. On August 9th, Mr. Towsley was deprived, August 9th of 2023, he was deprived of visitation. The county had submitted a letter or a request to suspend the visit. The judge said put it in writing. And then two weeks later, the judge made his ruling on the 23rd. He made his ruling in the dispositional order of terminating rights. And Mr. Towsley was deprived of his visitation. On the face, it appears moot, and I agree with 75% of what the trial court did. But really, a decision should have been made whether there was a violation because this could reoccur itself in some other situation where there's a different termination of parental rights. And if indeed there was a violation of a visitation order, that militates against the department using diligent efforts if they're going to unilaterally just disobey an order without going to court. And if Mr. Towsley had other children that somehow were removed, he could possibly use that argument that, look, I had this case in the past where there was a contempt finding against the department that they deprived me of my contact with my children, which affected my ultimate rights to receive them back.

We'll take a look at that, counsel. Thank you.

Thank you, Judge.

Counsel?

If I'm on mute, can you hear me?

Yes. Speak up a little bit.

Sure. Sean Sterling. I represent the Jefferson County Department of Social Services. I actually was trial counsel on this as well. Just want to address the points that were raised by Mr. DiGiorgio before I move on to the other. this was a lengthy case. I think there were a lot of considerations that led to, you know, the delayed filing of permanent neglect. And that included, you know, some periods of COVID time and things of that nature that kind of delayed it. So the termination petition wasn't filed until well after the first 15 months in this case. Mr. Townsley had plenty of opportunity prior to us filing our petition, our termination petition to address these concerns that we had. And, you know, as you can see in the trial record, he was very competitive the whole time. And it was not just with the department. It was with every service provider that he had to deal with. Now, the argument that, you know, that he just has to participate in these services and that will lead to a reunification that troubling I guess on its face because if parents are expected to just sit in a room while still holding on to the feelings in the ways that led to the children having to be removed in the first place and then to have the children removed with no progress whatsoever, that seems to be, I guess it makes it meaningless for us to even offer the services in the first place.

Counsel, I have a question.

Sure.

Do you think this was a close case?

No, not really.

And why not?

I think that Mr. Towsley didn't take any of the concerns that we had seriously. He refused to address them. I saw very little difference. The department saw very little difference between where he was at the beginning of the case and where he was at the end of the case. Where it was addressed already that he was kind of given that chance to maybe earn a suspended judgment prior to where the judge had increased his visitation. We did some in-home visitation with all the children. So that to me, I took that from the court as, you know, here's your chance to show us that you're actually going to make some verifiable progress. And during that period of time, we're probably the most egregious outburst that he had made.

And can you speak to the corporal punishment that was happening?

um yeah sure i i believe you know mr cowsley had a very firm belief in corporal punishment um to the to the point where you know even even when he's told that this maybe you hold on to these beliefs but during this this we're asking you not to do it during this this setting um and he was resistant even in the setting where the children are being supervised and he has assistance of other persons, he still would engage in the corporal punishment, which, you know, to the department and to the service provider, if he's willing to do that when the children are in his care and custody, or not in his care and custody, and he's being supervised, it's a big red flag for them if the children were to be returned to him. The department had separated visits even, because they were quite chaotic. There were five kids. And, you know, I think that was towards the end when the judge had ordered the visits to be combined and to increase the visitation, it was to see if there were even, there wasn't even a chance that he would be able to take all of the children in that way and handle them appropriately. And it was just a failure on all accounts in that regard.

Anything else, Russell?

Just to the other petition, the enforcement petition, I believe it was, that was filed towards the end of the case. That, on its face, you know, Mr. DiGiorgio had referenced it as a contempt proceeding, but it was not a contempt proceeding. It was simply a request for an enforcement of an order. There was no order of any kind of parenting time. There was an order prior for certain visitation of before the dispositional period, but there was no actual order to enforce. The department had increasing behaviors that were exhibited and the children's own counselor was recommending against the contact. So the filing of the actual order by the court that his visitation was ended basically made it a moot point. So, I mean, the only thing that they could have really ordered was to make up the visitation, which would fly in the face of their determination. Thank you, counsel.

Thank you. Mr. Otis?

Thank you. I'm here on behalf of the children today. These five girls are now aged 5 through 11. They've been in care for five years next month. They certainly deserve permanency. The respondent has never taken any responsibility for the domestic violence and the unsafe living conditions and the feral, hyper-sexualized life that they had endured while they were in his care. The respondent was negatively discharged from most of his programming. He never showed any benefit from his services. He remained combative toward DSS caseworkers and all of the programming staff throughout. He never even managed to progress to unsupervised parenting time. I interviewed the girls a number of times pursuant to ongoing permanency proceedings, and as recently as last night, they're very bonded with their foster family. They feel a desperate need for adoption. So I would ask the court to affirm the trial decisions and allow these children to be adopted. Thank you, counsel.

Thank you. Cases 148 and 153.

Thank you Council Council Council yes you've got the floor

thank you I will stand on what is in my brief the children are doing well as is indicated in the brief they've been adopted already they have permanency and none of the appeals here asked to overturn the neglect. They only asked for a new hearing which would not be in my client's best interest.

Very good. Thank you, Council.

Thank you. case 152 scott t versus jefferson county dss 152. 152.

Can we just do that with 157?

Oh, 152. 152 was with 147. My apologies. My apologies. Thank you.

154. Todaro v. Malinkowski.

Thank you. Good morning, Your Honors. Thank you for the behalf of plaintiff, appellant. May please the court. Here we are seeking to obviously have this court review a lower court's determination that granted summary judgment to the respondents in this action. We submit that the trial court's reliance on the expert opinions of Dr. Castellani and Dr. Pearson were inappropriate. Dr. Castellani, I am a doctor, two years post-accident, reviews medical records and determines that the plaintiff, Nathaniel Totaro appellant, had suffered injuries. He includes, though, or concludes, though, that those injuries are minor cervical strain and sermogenic headaches, in addition, a less severe thorough lumbar strain. He goes on to state he suspects these would resolve itself within a short period of time. He does not directly opine, though, that it did resolve in a short period of time, one that would suggest or try to support the argument that he did not suffer a significant limitation. In fact, Dr. Castellani reviewed the medical records of Dr. Landy. Those medical records were a neurologist that treated or provided treatment to the appellant, and that treatment was seven months post-accident. And those treatment records indicated, as per Dr. Castellani's report, that there were still range of motion limitations, orthopedic findings of injury, positive orthopedic findings of injury, and various MRI findings of injury, including disc bulges and herniations and the like. Dr. Castellani, in his own report, also finds injuries. He states there are a range of motion limitations. There's a disc protrusion at C4, C5, osteophyte disc complex into the spinal canal, disc space narrowing, strengthening the lumbar lordosis and an annular bulge. He seems to suggest, though, in his opinion, and that is which plaintiff, I'm sorry, respondent relies upon, is that because he didn't suffer, plaintiff, a herniation, he doesn't have a qualifying injury. And that just isn't what the case law would suggest. In fact, bulges, tears, stenosis, and all that, coupled with range of motion limitations and those orthopedic tests that all of which plaintiff appellant has submitted would suffice at least a significant limitation of injury. So we would submit that Dr. Castellani's report actually runs or his findings run contrary to his speculation or conclusions therein, that they were merely conclusory. And we liken this to the Banas versus Waikiki, I think it is, in which we think just like in here that, or just like in that case, that the report itself would in fact create its own questions of fact, precluding summary judgment from respondent in this case. Also submitted in support of-

So your argument would be the burden never shifts.

It never shifted, no. Their report alone suggests that there are injury findings. And you know, in fact, it lists findings. It says, yeah, he definitely suffered these injuries, but we're gonna call them a strain and strains should heal themselves. But it actually doesn't ever comment when the injuries healed. He takes note that in fact, the plaintiff presented a seven months post-accident and these what the findings were. He doesn't refute those findings. He doesn't say that Dr. Landy was inappropriate in suggesting those findings or anything of that sort. He just similarly concludes, well, they should heal quickly.

Counsel, it may be difficult for a treating physician to pinpoint when a particular injury might heal or not and what that actually even means, how you can even define heal is reach some level of stability, I guess. But here, the issue we have is that we have these range of motion deficits specifically, which is sort of like this hallmark sign. Are you arguing essentially that an IME doctor, once you find them, once you find those range of motion deficits, you need to explain something separate from the incident, some preexisting, something new, something subsequent, whatever, something different from the incident. If you fail to do that, we're left with an issue of fact.

Right. It's inconclusive. You know, it's pure speculation. And here he did nothing to suggest that it was pre-accident or pre-existing. In fact, there are no pre-accident records reviewed by any defense expert in this case. Dr. Pearson doesn't review any pre-accident records, and certainly Dr. Castellani doesn't. So the suggestion that these are degenerative or that these findings are not related to the accident just falls flat. we don't think it's sufficient

any further

um with regards if i may just very briefly with regards to dr pearson um you know dr pearson first i would suggest and i saw respondents brief cited him as a board certified radiologist that's nowhere in the record dr pearson's report simply doesn't state that at all it merely suggests he's a physician authorized to practice in the state of new york and we submit that's insufficient nonetheless turning to um his report itself if if this court were to consider it, you know, in Dr. Pearson's report, he does not, he states he has an inability to confirm that the findings are related to the accident. And again, we submit that is insufficient, you know, again, to bring it home, speculation and conjecture alone, it just isn't enough to warrant summary judgment, dismissing plaintiff's complaint.

If there's anything further from this.

Nothing further. Thank you.

Thank you. Honors. Good morning, Your Honors. Rachel Emmerer for the defendant respondent. Just to respond to the points made, Dr. Pearson is a board certified radiologist. At the bottom of his report, he specifically states that as well as his qualifications to comment on this case. That issue as to his qualifications was never raised below. Dr. Pearson is qualified. So just turning to his report, he focuses on the alleged findings on the MRI. Dr. Pearson goes into detail about traumatic findings versus degenerative findings. He's explaining what exactly he's looking for and what he uses to make his opinion. He says there's no signs of trauma on the MRI. And I do want to note that a disc herniation, because counsel had mentioned just generally, oh, there's findings, right? Well, a finding in and of itself doesn't meet the standard here, right? That finding needs to be traumatic, acute, or causally related to the accident. And that finding needs to also be correlated to a significant limitation to reach threshold.

So isn't that going to be plaintiff's burden at trial? They have to make that causative link at trial. They have to say these injuries, these range of motion deficits are related to the injury. That becomes their burden at trial. Here, summary judgment, isn't that your burden to prove that negative, that it's related, these range of motion deficits are related to something different? Maybe degeneration, maybe you get something different.

Yeah, I understand your question. And we do have that burden on this motion. And we met that burden. I think the distinction here and what makes this case a little different than the asking the question, what are those range of motion findings related to? The position here for us and based on the evidence, both what the defense submitted as well as what the plaintiff submitted, and I'll get to that in a second, but does our burden, first, is there a physical injury, right? So that's our And first question, is there a physical injury? And the evidence based on Dr. Pearson's radiology review and the IME, no, there is no physical injury. And then the second question is, does that physical injury rise to the level of a significant limitation or a permanent consequential limitation? It does not happen in this case, right? So just to talk a little bit more substantively right Mr Totoro goes to the emergency room and this is all noted in Dr Castellani report which we submitted to meet our burden Mr Tutoro goes to the emergency room They find no traumatic injury. They find he has normal range of motion findings. At most, they find a sprain, which is exactly the finding of Dr. Castellani. Um, after that, um, he, he gets an MRI, right? Um, that MRI in and of itself, um, and just going, I know I'm backtracking a little bit, but disc herniation, disc extrusion, disc protrusion is not even alleged in this case, right? So we're not, when, when counsel comes up here and says there's some findings, those findings aren't even alleged in the first place in this case. And those findings aren't on the MRI, right? So Mr. Tutorial then goes and gets an EMG. That EMG finds no cervical radiculopathy. He goes and gets an MRI. There's no findings as to herniations, disc protrusions on that MRI. At most, there's a bulge. The bulge in and of itself doesn't rise to the level of a serious injury. You need something else to correlate to a significant limitation, or is that bulge, is that causing problems? It's not based on the imaging. And that's Mr. Totoro's own treating doctor. Dr. Landy says there's no nerve compression, no nerve or cord abnormalities. So that supposed injury that they're alleging doesn't rise to the level of a serious injury. And just to note again, on the findings, that lumbar MRI that Mr. Toro gets actually cause that, that report in and of itself calls that level where that bulge is, they call it, they don't actually call it, they know it a bulge, but they actually call it a disc osteophyte complex and call it degenerative. So that report in and of itself, again, is supporting the defense's burden that this is a degenerative finding. And because plaintiff doesn't submit an expert affidavit or anything in their motion to say that this rises to the level of a serious injury. Is this supposed bulge in the first instance? If it's there and if it's related to the accident, which they submit nothing that it is, even if it is at that point, does that rise to the level of a serious injury? And there's no evidence in the record that it does. right? That there's no cervical reticulopathy. Range of motion findings, for the most part, are normal, right? Dr. Landy finds normal range of motion. And then Mr. Totoro stops treatment at this point, four years ago, two years before the motion for summary judgment.

So doesn't Dr. Castellani find range of motion deficits on both the lumbar and cervical areas of the best?

So Dr. Landy does find range of motion findings. And so does Castellani.

I'm sorry, what was that?

Doesn't Dr. Castellani, the IME itself, doesn't that find significant range of motion issues?

So yeah, and then just turning to those range of motion findings, I think you need to look at those first in the context of the history of the case. So the only range of motion findings in the less than one year that Mr. Totoro treated, they were essentially normal, sometimes above normal. But if there was any decrease, which many of the times there wasn't even a decrease found within that year, but if there was, it was a slight decrease, not enough to reach that serious injury threshold. But what's interesting is that Mr. Totoro, when he goes at his last treatment visit with Dr. Landy, he has essentially a normal exam. Dr. Landy finds normal range of motion. And that's his last visit. That doesn't even account for the few visits before that, that again, he's having normal range of motion. So at that point, when he stops treatment in 2020, he has normal range of normal range of motion. And then Mr. Totoro stops treatment at that point. He doesn't follow up. He has no treatment for two years at that point. So Dr. Castellani explains that when Mr. Totoro comes back for his IME and has these subjective, subjective, subjective, so that that's based on his effort those subjective range of motion findings that are substantially lower than they ever been at any point in the history of this case He explains that that causal link between the accident and these subjective range of motion findings that that's eliminated at that point. But again, even with those range of motion findings, that in and of itself isn't going to reach the level of threshold, right? Are those related to some objective finding? and the evidence in the record in its entirety does not do that. Dr. Pearson and Dr. Castellani explained that and plaintiff submission again doesn't make any sort of causal link because they don't submit an expert affidavit. At most-

Counsel, you should begin to wrap up.

Okay, thank you. I just want to point out just at most what's submitted again in plaintiff's finding is the no fault IME, which again supports resolving strains, plaintiff that he could work and do his activities of daily living. And I just want to wrap up with that, that that plaintiff's own testimony that he says, I could do completely everything after the accident, I can work my two jobs after the accident, I didn't have any restrictions or limitations after the accident, That's coming from him as well during the entirety of the case. So I think looking at both the objective evidence on the IMEs, well, the single IME that he has, as well as the limitations, which are non-existent, that this case, even considering all the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, it just doesn't reach threshold.

So I look at that, Councilman. Thank you.

Thank you.

Yes, I can. Good morning. We can hear you loud and clear. Please proceed.

Thank you. Good morning. May it please the court. I will take that. My name is Mark Sherman, and I represent the defendant appellant. In this case, I'll take far less than the 15 minutes allotted to me this morning for my argument. You know, turning back to your wiser words to this morning's newly admitted attorneys, I recalled the early days of my career when friends, family, neighbors, and others seemed to come out of the woodwork to ask me for legal advice on all manner of subjects. I quickly realized how little I do, but I remember that in many of the matters that were submitted to me, I struggled to see that they actually amounted to real legal controversies, much less controversies that warranted the time and money of litigation. frequently then and now with the benefit of years of experience. The best counsel was to gently suggest that despite the existence of a very real problem, there was not necessarily any legal remedy. Similarly, in this case, Ms. Welch, the plaintiff, suffered a very real problem, and there is no dispute that she fell and injured herself. We submit, however, that her unfortunate accident is not one for which there is any legal remedy against the defendant because there's no evidence that the defendant breached any duty to her or that the defendant committed any causally related statutory violation.

counsel in your in your brief um you spend and i'm looking at pages 19 and 20 primarily you spend a little bit of time uh i think being critical of the plaintiff's expert where you talk about how the plaintiff's expert came to this conclusion that these are permanent stairs uh they talk about because they're in a permanent setting because they're carpeted and then talks about the duration of time that they existed and you say that he was failing to cite any authority as to why it's permanent. The plaintiff's expert goes on to say that the section that he's referring to, the stairway section of the code, applies to temporary stairs too. So he's essentially arguing that this bleacher section that your expert relies on and the stairway section that the plaintiff's expert relies on, these aren't mutually exclusive. You can have a particular set of stairs that qualifies under both. I don't see your expert giving any authority either for this claim that it only bleacher not stairway and that there mutually exclusive Where the authority for that

Well the code applies, the code that is cited by the plaintiff's expert and that the plaintiff relies upon expressly applies to permanent stairs, which bleachers are defined specifically as being temporary structures.

But the word permanent isn't used in the stairway section. It says one or more flights of stairs exterior or interior with necessary landings and platforms that form a continuous and uninterrupted passage from one level to another. That's it. It doesn't say whether they're permanent or temporary.

That's a fair point, Your Honor. Nevertheless, it's our expert's opinion that the code as worded, whether it uses the word permanent or not in reference to stairs, doesn't apply to temporary structures such as bleachers.

But were they temporary? I guess weren't they up for a long time? There were something that they take apart every time or anything of that nature, correct?

That's true. The fact that they were in that auditorium and were not dismantled or moved at any known time, however, does not change the nature of the structure. The fact that the structure is permanent, it is something that can be dismantled with simple tools, as opposed to built in stairs that are made of concrete and that are fixtures to the building itself.

Where's the thing about dismantled with certain tools? I don't see that. Where does that come from?

Well, the fact that the bleachers are temporary, the temporariness of the bleachers comes from the fact that they can be dismantled and moved easily with tools, as opposed to permanently inbuilt stairs, which cannot be moved except by demolishing them. and because they are permanent fixtures of the building.

Well, I don't say the word temporary, but I do see the word not a building element. And that might be what you're referring to with this whole thing. But that phrase, not a building element, I don't know what that means. It seems to me that you can take apart anything you want, depending on how far you want to go and put it back together again. But I don't know if I don't see anything in any authority that, you know, whether you take it apart with a screwdriver versus a wrench versus some other type of equipment, matters for these definitions. And so I don't know that your expert says it either.

Fair enough, Your Honor. It's nevertheless our contention that the plaintiff's expert provided the court with nothing more than a convoluted hodgepodge of photos and copied and pasted statutes and disjointed conclusions which failed to set forth accurate measurements and which also ignored the plaintiff's own testimony and instead invented testimony for her by saying that her accident was called by a so-called disruption in the rhythm of her movement as she descended the stairs. She never said any such thing. And the motion court erred in several ways, including by crediting that theory of the plaintiff's expert. That is, despite the fact that the plaintiff's expert had not reviewed the deposition transcript, as well as his citation to inapplicable statutes, as we maintain, the court credited the expert's opinion that excessive variation disrupted the plaintiff's balance after she developed a rhythm on the stairs. She never testified anything like that. To the contrary, her testimony was that she was moving down the stairs slowly.

Council, these all sound like great points to maybe raise on cross-examination during a trial.

Thank you, Your Honor. I think that they also have failed to raise an issue of fact

The burden has to shift first, right? You have the burden here and pointing out gaps in the non-moving parties papers doesn't really get you too far. You have to first satisfy your own burden. But you should begin to start thinking about wrapping up.

Okay. Well, to that, Your Honor, I would just suggest that, you know, although I struggled to find case law in the Fourth Department, admittedly, there is ample case law where expert opinions that are conclusory, speculative, or unsupported by the record are insufficient to raise tribal issues of fact. So as to preclude summary judgment, talk about conclusory statements. The plaintiff's expert in disputing the defense expert simply states in paragraph nine of his affidavit, based upon my review of the applicable code, the defendant's expert is incorrect, period. Nothing more. No statutes, no citations, no facts, nothing. In addition to such conclusory statements, the expert relies on speculative and unsupported theories such as this disruption of Ms. Welch's Pace theory. And these are insufficient to raise issues of fact. And accordingly, summary judgment should be granted, therefore request that the judgment of the motion court be reversed. Thank you.

Thank you, counsel.

May it please the court, Lorenzo and Palatano for the respondent in this matter. Your Honor, this is a relatively straightforward case. It's just down to liability regarding the stairs where the respondent fell and was seriously injured. As an initial matter, I don't believe the appellate in this case met its burden for summary judgment. There was nothing to show that it was unaware of the condition of the stairs or that didn't create the dangerous or defective condition, according to the case law I submitted in our brief. There was no maintenance record, inspection record submitted in this case. And we talk about conclusory. There was an affidavit submitted by the executive pastor, but there was nothing mentioned about, you know, we regularly inspect the place. The cleaning staff goes by. They look at the stairs. his conclusion was just basically, well, I never heard a complaint, so there wasn't a problem. And I just don't think that that's conclusory, and I don't think the court below found that convincing.

What about the fact that there was a building code violation? Is that conclusory? Is that a fact?

No, Your Honor, I think it goes to what this court talked about in the Palmer case. It's the classic battle of experts. as Justice Nowak indicated, the codes are not mutually exclusive. So it's just their expert says the stairs are not defective and they're proper. Our two experts actually say stairs weren't proper. They lacked a proper handrail. The risers were different lengths. I think the court below correctly concluded, hey, this is a credibility issue. We can't decide this on the sermon judgment motion. These are things that need to be submitted to the jury. decide. I think they're expert relying on just saying these are temporary structures. Judge Keene, I think you asked a great question. Are these really temporary? I mean, the bleachers at Yankee Stadium are called bleachers. I don't think those are temporary. These bleachers were there for, you can call them bleachers all you want. They're sticks. They've been there for years. And just to say, well, they can maybe be taken apart by tools. Everything can be taken apart by tools. Your Honor's Bench could be taken apart by tools, but I wouldn't call that temporary. So I think these are just classic issues. Again, battle the experts that should be resolved by a jury. Those are issues of fact for trial. And again, with respect to any credibility issues on behalf of the plaintiff, I don't think there are, but if there are inconsistencies between her deposition testimony and the affidavit submitted in opposition to the summary judgment motion. Again, Justice Whammon, those are credibility issues. That's great ammunition for cross-examination, but those are not issues I think the court should decide in summary judgment motion. So for all those issues, I think the court should affirm the court below's decision. Thank you, Your Honor.

Thank you, counsel. No other questions. Thank you.

Case 156, Route 90, LLC versus Meshurian UBIF Franchise LLC

Mr. Byrd, can you hear us?

I can hear you, Your Honors. Can you hear me?

We can very well. Please proceed, Counsel.

Thank you, Your Honors. Matt Byrd on behalf of the Plaintiff's Appellants. I just want to highlight a couple key facts and jump into point one of my brief. And just briefly, this is a case where the plaintiffs started a business, you break, I fix, which I'm sure everyone's familiar with. They fix and service phones and various other electronics. They started this business. They had no intent to sell this business. They were contacted by respondents to purchase the business. Negotiations ensued. These negotiations are set forth in my papers. But what it boils down to is my clients were seeking five and a half million dollars. When negotiations did not reach that level, what Assurion had said to my clients was, was there any flexibility in this price if we offer you jobs? There was another representation that essentially these jobs will continue until you found your next thing. It was based on these representations that ultimately there was a price of $3.5 million agreed to, and jobs were provided to the members of these companies, one being Nathan Bouts, who is a plaintiff's here. Ten months after that, he's terminated his position, which gets us to the lower court, which now gets us in front of your court.

Counsel, I think you have missed two really important things that happened between what you started to say, and then in the end, I'm getting terminated. And those two things are two contracts, okay, that were entered into between your clients and the people who were buying their company and what was said in those contracts, okay. And that's a huge event that happened in between him getting fired and him selling the business. Is that right?

That's correct. That's correct, Your Honor. And I apologize for jumping over those. But if I move to point one of my brief, and that kind of addresses this point, what the lower court said in dismissing this first cause of action for fraud and fraud inducement is what the court said was it was based, the negotiation was based on the salary, essentially, and not the duration of employment. That's not what we've alleged. And I think that addresses your point, that there were these negotiations happening before the contract was entered into with respect to the transfer of the business.

I have more questions before you get further than that. All right. So after negotiations, then everybody sat down and came up with these contracts. It is my understanding that your client was represented by counsel throughout the contract forming time. Is that right?

Correct. Separate counsel. but yes.

All right. No, but they had a lawyer that could have said, hey, you know, they made promises during negotiations. Let's make sure we get them in writing. Okay. And I'm sure if they were, you know, halfway decent lawyers, they would have said, yeah, let's get that straight. Let's put that in the contract. So we have the writing to rely on. That didn't come out in the contract did it, that they could stay in these jobs for as long as they want, and that the jobs were consideration for not paying $5.5 million, but only paying $3.5 million.

You're correct that that was not found in the contract, Your Honor. You're correct about that. And I would say to that that if you look at the case law cited in our first point, it really doesn't matter that that term was in the contract. If you look at the case, and it's on page 14 of my brief, but essentially what it says is what the court, and this is what the lower carp should have looked at. It should have looked at whether there was an allegation alleged of an injury separate and distinct from the termination of employment. And that point gets us around kind of the at will employment and whether everything was in this agreement. Because if we've alleged on a pre-answer motion dismissed that there's an injury separate and distinct from the termination, which there was an employment agreement in place, if we get around that, then that first cause of action shouldn't have been dismissed. Now here, we've alleged numerous times that there's an injury here, not just based on the salary that they would have received, but that a business that they grew was transferred essentially on this promise that it would continue. So what I would say is that you can look at these negotiations and statements and promises made prior to the contract.

Let's talk about promises, promises to continue employment Let just chat about that for a second Okay so the contract It talked about what would happen to the employment if the closing didn occur correct

That correct Okay It talked about what would happen if he worked there less than six months He wouldn't get his bonus. It talked about what would happen if he worked there more than six months and that he would get a bonus. And in fact, he got a $10,000 bonus for working more than six months. So the I guess what I'm leading to is the contract, the employee retention agreement anticipated that his employment could end at any time. And there were various points that certain things would happen and they were all written out in this contract. OK, and there was it was also apparent to me that very carefully and in bigger words than anywhere else in that contract, the idea that this was a at will employment and that it appeared well spelled out in the contract that, you know, nothing was promised. okay that's a the definition of at will i mean there was pains taken to to put down the various um time frames and what would happen if the employment ended so i think they anticipated that at some point you know that the um employment would end but and they they made um contingencies for all of those places that it might have or could have or in fact did end. So I guess what I'm trying to figure out what the relevance of your negotiations were pre-contract.

The relevance, and I'll be brief on this, but the relevance of that is that this was a promise made prior to entering into the contract. And as I mentioned, it does not matter if that's an at-will contract. If you look at the elements of a cause of action for fraud and fraud in the inducement, if there's an injury alleged based on a misrepresentation prior to entering into the contract, it does not matter that it's at will. We've alleged that here. So that's where I think the error is. And the lower court did kind of get to that point, but not completely, because what the lower court said was based on salary, not duration, which the court didn't even really address the at will employment. So the court recognized kind of this legal principle, but we respectfully think that the court made the wrong decision. Thank you, counsel.

Any further?

Nothing further. Thank you, Your Honors.

Thank you. Good morning, Your Honors. I'll be very brief. I believe this is a very straightforward case, and I think Judge Bannister raised all of the issues that I was going to raise. there are clear contracts here. If all of our clients had contracts that were this transparent and straightforward, capital letters, very clear language on the first page of the agreement, there was no question but that Mr. Bouts knew what he was signing. He was represented by counsel, and it was incumbent on him to read the contract before he signed it, which if he didn't, then if he did, he would have clearly seen the terms that were contained therein, and our client complied with all of those terms.

If there are no further questions.

No questions, counsel. Thank you.

Thank you. Case 157, Fang versus Town of Amherst.

good morning your honors mr feng if you could just wait one minute we're going to make sure that your opponent is on the screen and ready to go

oh i'm sorry mr alba good morning your honors uh i can hear you can you hear me okay

we can hear you fine Thank you. Mr. Bang, please proceed.

Okay. May the please call. This appeal seeks an end to defendants use procedural technicality to avoid its municipal duties. Contrary to defendant's assertion, the plaintiff actually have fully complied with all statutory requirements. The first, the plaintiff's refiling is not barred by the statute of limitation. And during the first appeal, this court upheld the lower court's decision concluding that the trial court had made its decision only after securing the defense counsel's concession that the plaintiff's refile would not be precluded by the statute of limitation, allow plaintiff to refile. In addition the doctrine of continuous wrong applies here As this quote indicated in Sniper v City of Syracuse the municipality has a duty to continuously maintain the safe road condition This defendant refused to remedy the road hazards constitute a continual wrong. As long as these road hazards pose harm to the people or their properties, the statute of limitation remains taught. The second, plaintiff has complied the municipal law section 50H. upon this course of the decision

how did you comply with 50H when you did not go to the 50H hearing

I will address this let's address this first okay what you're talking about is March 29th 2022 hearing that the defenders rely on so much right but this is a displaced misplaced because the choice court's decision dismissal without prejudice that permitted but did not mandate the plaintiff to refile. Plaintiff may choose to refile or not to refile. So without a valid notice of claim, the defendant had no way of knowing whether the plaintiff will refile or not. Therefore, the defendant had no reason, no right, to even demand a hearing without a valid notice of claim. According to Section 5821, They have to, okay, let's address this. Besides, that hearing is allegedly arranged for 15 months before Planteau filed the notice of claim on June 30, 2023. So that makes it irrelevant to this refiled case.

We'll take a look, Nick. Is there anything further?

Yes. Okay. Then we'll go back to our continuous ways. So when this court made the decision entered on June 9, 2023, the plaintiff filed a notice of claim timely on June 30, 2023, to initiate a refile. however the defendant failed to request a hearing within the 90-day statutory time frame therefore the plaintiff was committed to refile the case without attaining a hearing that's according to section 5835

we'll take a look at that okay anything further

And the third, the prior written notice defense does not apply here. In Babu V, City of Buffalo, the Court of Appeals held that municipalities cannot invoke this defense when the defects or hazards were resulted from their own affirmative act of negligence. In this case, the defendant created those road hazards, therefore, made prior notice unnecessary. So this is a show that the plaintiff will comply with all statutory requirements. The issue here is the two, I mean, the load hazard. The first one is a nine inch street curb that exceeded the New York State DOT's safety limit six inch maximum by 50%. Also, over 30 imaging studies that he could have chose from before the accident between the cervical and lumbar spine, and none of that is addressed. And if we look at Dr. Landy's opinion, because I really don't think that this is a battle of the experts. Dr. Landy provides a one-sentence opinion that Ms. Simmons suffers prolonged symptoms from the accident. What is the injury? Was it her spine? Was it the cervical spine? Was it the lumbar spine? That very basic question of what the injury is was never answered. Miss Simmons had prolonged symptoms for well over a decade before this accident. So him simply saying she has symptoms and we don't dispute that. We don't dispute that she's significantly limited after the accident, but it's not causally related to this accident. So his opinion is completely deficient in that regard He also doesn talk about the nature and extent the duration what her limitations are He is completely silent as to all of that as is the entirety of their submission And actually, one of the affidavits submitted by plaintiff appellant was Dr. Mills that says, oh, she has a resolved spinal sprain. She has these subjective complaints, which she had long before this accident and there was no objective evidence to support any causally related injury to this accident. So even their submission that they submitted supports summary judgment in favor of the defense. I think the court really went through this in great detail and I think that they're finding that this case should be dismissed below. I think that should be affirmed. Thank you.

Thank you.
